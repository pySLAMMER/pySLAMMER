Tasks
1. I don't want periods in the version numbering replaced with underscores in the results filenames. Change how that's made and make sure to refactor all the tests and verification scripts to expect the updated format.
2. Update `collect_and_save_pyslammer_results()` to delete the cached results after they're added to the overall results file.
3. Create a developer's verification guide outlining how to use pytest to check different versions of pyslammer
